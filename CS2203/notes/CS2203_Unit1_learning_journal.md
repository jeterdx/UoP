# Part1 : Reflect on Unit 1
## Concepts learned in Unit 1
- There are lots I have learned in this unit since this is almost the first time to learn about the concept of DBMS as a whole. The biggest learning of this unit is about the importance of getting a clear image about business requirement of clients. As I proceeded the process of modeling relation sets and entity sets, questions like "Is this really necessary data to store?" or "Why this should be an independent entity?" came to my mind. As many of peers mentioned the lack of users' technical skill as a disadvantage of developing a DBMS, it is quite a difficult to be in the same language between tech people and non-tech people. A miscommunication between these two can result in a big damage to the quality of DBMS. So this is the biggest learning of this unit and I am going to keep this in my mind in the rest of units.

## Reading Assignmen
Completion Date: 4/9
- I read through the reading assignment, mainly focusing on the part of case study of library system. It gave me a lot of learnings about the process of making sharp DBMS concept model along with the business requiremnet of clients. The most impressive part was the relation set. It was really insightful to clarify the relationship of data and data, removing unnecessary requirements.


## Discussion Assignment
Completion Date: 4/13
- I learned the process of how to compare the good and bad of developing DBMS, replacing an existing legacy file system. What impressed me was the part that I had to think about many variables to determine the advantages and disadvantages of DBMS. This was real part of business and project. Also, I was a little bit struggling to find the disadvantages of them. Since I am on the side of developers, I am likely to be biased to see many good points of DBMS. But the most important thing is how to figure out their business and clarify the issues needed to be solved for their business. So I needed to be balanced on the both side throughout the view of business side of client and its disadvantages.

## Assignment
Completion Date: 4/11
- Developing each component needed for DBMD, entity set lists, entity set and relation set was really great chance to trace the DBMS development system. Also, applying each constraint of this case study give a clear vision to each attribute.

# Part2 : Appropiate role for me.
- If I have to say one role I would start from DBA. Since I am working as an infrastructure engineer, DBA is the most familiar role in the domain of database. Actually I am trying the get a task from DB team as DBA. But still I am not enough skilled to work as DBA, based on the requirement of DBA such as a deep understanding of computing strucutre of DB system or vendor specific knowledge like Oracle database. Therefore, I am going to foster the first part of skill set in this course and the second part in my company training, in order to get a task as DBA.
