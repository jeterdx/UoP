# Reflect on Unit 1

## Concepts learned in Unit 1

- I have learned a lot in this unit since I was on the absent period for the last two terms and forgot many aspects of Java. Especially, the usage of try-catch statement is new concept for me since I was surrounded by Golang for this half of year. Also, the concept of robustness is also insightful for me since when I think of error handling, I was likely to think about how to prevent programs from crashing. But as the text shows, preventing all exceptions and errors is not smart way to develop software, since it can result in unexpected outcomes and users or other programs cannot detect it, which result in the misunderstanding of entire outcome. So, the important thing is to keep reasonable way to handle exceptions and errors.



## Reading Assignment

Completion Date: 4/9

- As I started the reading assignment early in this week, I did not struggle to finish all of them. Also, the content was new to me and worth spending time. Especially, the diagram showed on text about the relationship of errors, exceptions and throwable classes gave me a clear view of how error and exception are related to each other. If I can raise one point that I can do more, I did not complete aï½Ž exercise or practice at the end of chapter. So, I am going to try to complete them in the next Unit.



## Discussion Assignment

Completion Date: 4/13

- My first impression on the topic of this week is very abstract. There is no direct source about the topic on the textbook, so I guessed the topic required me to understand and think deeply about how the error handling is working in Java language. Throughout the thinking process, I read through text many times and I acquired a learning I wrote above. So, I am going to continue to be careful about what is required on this discussion topic.



## Assignment

Completion Date: 4/11

- I really enjoyed two assignments of Lab2. Especially I prefer low-level layer concept of computer science and that is what I want to learn in this university, so the second part, a fetch data from web URL and store it into file through data stream of Java, was exciting for me. Only one thing that confused me was nosy proposals from Eclipse about my code. As I am not familiar with Java and do not understand the concept well so far, I followed the instruction and broke my code a few times. I am going to think well before following the instructions in the future.


## Self-Quiz
Completion Date: 4/11
- Self-Quiz was the most difficult part for me in this Unit, since following the sample code which is not quite meaningful or real application was tough exercise for me required me read through codes line by line with deep understanding. Especially the question about the characteristic of Throwable class was meaningful. To solve it, I needed to read text and understand the entire concept around exceptions well.
