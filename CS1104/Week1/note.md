"The Elements of Computing Systems: Building a Modern Computer from First Principles"
- In computer science, we take the notion of abstraction very concretely, defining it to be a statement of “what the entity does” and ignoring the details of “how it does it.”
- This book is about understanding what is happening inside of the computer when we run a simple program such as Hello-World.
-　x · y (or xy) means x And y, x + y means x Or y
-  Given a gate specification (interface), find an efficient way to implement it using other gates that were already implemented.
- A multiplexor (expressed as MUX) is a three-input gate that uses one of the inputs, called “selection bit,” to select and output one of the other two inputs, called “data bits.”
- . The AND gate, for instance, outputs a zero if any of the inputs equal zero. It doesn't matter what the other inputs are. This can be represented in a truth table with a third symbol called a "don't care". The "don't care", written as an 'X' in one of the input columns, indicates that the output does not depend on this input.
